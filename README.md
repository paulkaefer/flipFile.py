flipFile.py
===========

Reverse each line of a text file. It acts like a mirror, flipping (), [], {}, and <> characters.

Usage:

    python flipFile.py FILENAME " "

(Replace " " with a character in double-quotes to append to each line in the original, so the lines will all have the same length.)

Output:

    file with name FILENAME_flipped

To run the example:

    python flipFile.py cat " "
